														   <--- How to Setup --->							
The application includes of two parts serverside script and frontend,so to setup the application first we need to install Node.js along with some modules     "async": "^2.6.1" ,"body-parser": "^1.18.3", "ejs": "^2.6.1","eslint": "^5.9.0","express": "^4.16.4","mysql": "^2.16.0". We also need to have a server (apache or any other server ) installed along with mysql.
Before we run our script open text editor and change the username ,host and password variable in both pre-app.js and app.js to your server's configuration. 
Now after installing the application we need to run the following commands on the console.
	1)  node pre-app.js
This command will create a mysql database on the server.Now we can run our script.Now run the following command.
	2)  node app.js
That's it we have succesfully installed our script on the server at portno- 3000. We are good to go.

														   <--- How to run ---->
Open your browser and type following in the url box.
	1) localhost:3000 
This will open your server at port 3000. Now you should see a layout(frontend) with multiple input and classify options.
Now we can classify our data. 
But wait......
Which Classes ???
First we need to add categories and their attributes then accordingly we can classify.
Enjoy...
